Here is a description of the game: 
Beat Saber is a rhythm-based virtual reality (VR) game where players use two glowing sabers — one red and one blue — to slash incoming blocks that fly toward them in sync with music. Each block corresponds to a beat in the song and has a directional arrow showing which way to cut (up, down, left, right, or diagonally). The color of the block indicates which saber to use. Players must also dodge obstacles (like walls) by leaning or sidestepping. The experience feels like a mix of dancing, swordplay, and rhythm coordination.
